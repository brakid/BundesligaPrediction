    "# Building a prediction tool for soccer matches of the German soccer league (Bundesliga) using feed-forward neural networks.\n",
    "Soccer is by far the most prominent sports in Europe. Each country has its own, long-lived league and every weekend thousands of people gather together to watch their teams. Betting on the results of soccer matches is also quite popular. To make an educated guess about the result of a game, one has to look through various statistics that give insights into the teams current and past performance.\n",
    "As this is a time consuming process, it is handy to let a computer do the heavy lifting and let it predict the result of a match!\n",
    "In the last few years, the terms *Machine Learning* and *Neural Networks/Deep Learning* have become very popular. *Machine Learning* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) describes a set of algorithms that allow a computer to \"learn\" to solve a particular task, e.g classifying email into Spam or not Spam or predict the result of a soccer match. \n",
    "*Deep Learning* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) denotes a class of *Machine Learning* algorithms using artificial **Neural Networks** to accomplish the goal of \"learning\" how to solve a task with a computer. Artificial **Neural Networks** try to mimic the processes of firing neurons in the brain.\n",
    "The process of learning a task is done by training the network on sample data (e.g giving labeled examples of Spam emails and non-Spam emails) to let the network detect on how to distinguish both classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the problem we try to solve is finding a function $f$ such that:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "f(X) & = Y \\\\\n",
    "X: & \\text{input (e.g a suitable representation of an email)} \\\\\n",
    "Y: & \\text{output (e.g a binary classification 0/1 for spam/not spam)}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "As the real function $f$ that solves our problem perfectly is unknown, we search an approximation $\\tilde{f}$ with:\n",
    "$$f(X) \\approx \\tilde{f}(X), \\forall X$$\n",
    "During training we try to optimize $\\tilde{f}$ to get closer to the real function $f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to use such a Neural Network to build a predictor for soccer matches. We train the network on historical match data. Match data of the Bundesliga can be obtained from: https://www.openligadb.de/.\n",

    "### Retrieving the training data\n",
    "To be able to build a decent predictor for match results, we retrieve the match data of the years 2010 - 2017 from the API. The data is stored in a JSON format:\n",
    "\n",
    "    for year in 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017; \n",

    "Additionally we load the rankings at the end of the season as well:\n",
