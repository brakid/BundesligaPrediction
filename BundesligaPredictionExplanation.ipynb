    "# Building a prediction tool for soccer matches of the German soccer league (Bundesliga) using feed-forward neural networks.\n",
    "Soccer is by far the most prominent sports in Europe. Each country has its own, long-lived league and every weekend thousands of people gather together to watch their teams. Betting on the results of soccer matches is also quite popular. To make an educated guess about the result of a game, one has to look through various statistics that give insights into the teams current and past performance.\n",
    "As this is a time consuming process, it is handy to let a computer do the heavy lifting and let it predict the result of a match!\n",
    "In the last few years, the terms *Machine Learning* and *Neural Networks/Deep Learning* have become very popular. *Machine Learning* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) describes a set of algorithms that allow a computer to \"learn\" to solve a particular task, e.g classifying email into Spam or not Spam or predict the result of a soccer match. \n",
    "*Deep Learning* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) denotes a class of *Machine Learning* algorithms using artificial **Neural Networks** to accomplish the goal of \"learning\" how to solve a task with a computer. Artificial **Neural Networks** try to mimic the processes of firing neurons in the brain.\n",
    "The process of learning a task is done by training the network on sample data (e.g giving labeled examples of Spam emails and non-Spam emails) to let the network detect on how to distinguish both classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the problem we try to solve is finding a function *f* such that:\n",

    "During training we try to optimize *g* to get closer to the real function *f* using a loss function *L(f(X), g(X))* that describes the discrepancies between the results of *f* and *g*. This minimization is achieved by solving an optimization problem. We want to find parameters  of *g* (here weights in our neural network model) that minimize the value of our loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimizing the weights of a neural network during training is done by using the Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent) to calculate the rate of change we should apply to the weights of the network to achieve a better fit to the expected outcome compared to the outcome of the network. The process of applying these changes to the weights is done by *Backpropagation* in feed-forward networks (they propagate data in a single direction through the network = forward propagation) (https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/lecture/znwiG/forward-and-backward-propagation).\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a Neural Network to represent our function *g*, to build a predictor for soccer matches. We train the network on historical match data. Match data of the Bundesliga can be obtained from: https://www.openligadb.de/.\n",

We could represent each team by a single number (e.g Bayern Munich = 1, 1. FC Köln = 2...), but this has been proven to impact the accuracy of the neural networks. By assigning natural numbers to teams, we would introduce a mathematical order between teams. (E.g Bayern Munich < 1. FC Köln). This relation has no counterpart in the domain of soccer teams (at least not a global one. If you look at a snapshot of the leaue, then the ordering could represent the current ranking of the teams, but as the ranking is a changing over the course of a season it is not a meaningful quantity to our problem).\n",
